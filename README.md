# SolarCellDataAnalysis

**Objective** <br />
To display a solar cell energy data in real time and analyze that data <br />

This program takes solar cell data and displays it in real-time.
It then uses regression models to fit a model to the data and stores the predictions.
This project uses an already existing data set for testing purposes.
